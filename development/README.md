# Conway's Game of Life w/ React
Adaptation of the game of life simulation using the ReactJS library.

## First React App
This was the first thing that came to me in terms of "what do I try to build to learn how to work with this library?".

## Built with Webpack
I had never used Webpack before and since it seems to be paired with React so often, it seemed like a great opportunity to pick it up as well.

## Future Updates
Building this simulation has worked well with React and seems like the perfect use-case. I'll keep expounding on what a user can do to interact with the simulation. I'm considering offering features interesting enough to warrant a backend for users to save & share what they do with the app.
